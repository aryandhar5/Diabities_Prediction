## Introduction

Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early prediction can help in taking preventive measures. This project leverages machine learning to analyze medical data and predict the likelihood of diabetes.

## Dataset Description

**Source**: [Specify dataset source, e.g., Kaggle].  
The dataset includes the following features:
- **Pregnancies**
- **Glucose**
- **Blood Pressure**
- **Skin Thickness**
- **Insulin**
- **BMI**
- **Diabetes Pedigree Function**
- **Age**  
**Target**: Binary classification (1 = Diabetic, 0 = Non-Diabetic).
